## Application Description

## Technologies used
NodeJS - This powers the backend.
Express - This is used to get the server up, of course you know what it is.
ES-Lint - I've taken the liberty to set this up and following the airbnb starndard.
Babel - This is 2019, we're using es6 baby.
Handlebars - This is the templating engine powering our front-end
